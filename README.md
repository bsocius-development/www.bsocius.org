# bSocius

bSocius, is a simple, outstanding, open source media management tool. The tool is designed for receiving, organizing and publishing live photo and video content. So that you could share your greatest moments with your audiance as quickly as possible.

We are building BSocius as an open source alternative to other comparable services. Those services with a few exceptions are driven for revenue by selling your information to advertisers. We believe that BSocius could be an alternative for those services. With bSocius, you are in control of your data. 

# How does bSocius Work?

Let's set the stage for J-Festival, a three day yearly music festival. J-Festival wants to share a live photo and video stream and have those published as quickly as possible. In order to accomplish that, they hire three photographers where two of those photographers will be responsible for shooting video. Everything goes great until the first photographer delivers the photo via Dropbox. The second photographer delivers the photo's via google drive. And our third photographer has his own FTP server where we have to download those images manually. Now you have to manually sort and pick the images and or video you want, add relevant metadata, maybe write a small blog post, so that you or your team could publish it online.

BSocius provides a central hub for your content creators. They can now upload their content to your private hub. This could be done by uploading via a web based interface, FTP, or connecting there Dropbox, google drives to your private hub. Our smart algorithms are able to quickly sort those files into meaningful categories based on predefined filters and meta data. You will be able to quickly pick those images that capture those moments you want to share with the world, or to a private group. Also publishing your content on various social media is very easy with BSocius. You could simply create different media channels for publishing.
