            <p>
                LivePixel, is a simple, outstanding, opensource media management tool. The tool is designed for receiving, organizing and publishing live photo and video content. So that you could share your greatest moments with your audiance as quickly as possible.
            <p>
                We are building LivePixel as an opensource alternative to other comparable services. Those services with a few exceptions are driven for revenue by selling your information to advertisers. We believe that LivePixel could be an alternative for those services. <strong>With LivePixel, you are in control of your data and we will never sell your information to advertisers.</strong>

            <h2 class="content-subhead">How does LivePixel Work?</h2>
            <h3 class="content-subhead-small">A simple use case, J-Festival</h3>
            <p>
                Lets set the stage for J-Festival, a three day yearly music festival. J-Festival wants to share a live photo and video stream. In order to accomplish that, they hired three photographers and where two of those photographers will be
responsible for shooting video. Everthing goes great until the first photographer delivers the photo via dropbox. The second photograper delivers the photo's via google drive. Now our other media is made available via ftp.
